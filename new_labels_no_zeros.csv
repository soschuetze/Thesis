"Fascist NYPD leader Dermot Shea, who was just recently lying about small bail reforms, is now unsurprisingly trying to silence protests.

This campaign to show awareness for black lives matter was made with good intentions by @pepsi but it ended up back firing.

@JoshuaPotash Not a police officer in sight yet when #BLM meet to peacefully protest (WITHOUT SPEAKING A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE) police are in full force violating rights and forcing protesters to constantly stay mobile or get arrested,1
